# Key Features

**Multitaxa Annotation:** The dataset includes multilabel annotations, allowing for the classification of audio samples into multiple categories simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful for tasks involving signal classification in complex multi-species choruses.

**Expert Annotations:** This dataset comprises approximately 27 hours of audio recordings annotated by expert herpetologists. It has weak labels, with the presence and absence of species at a 60 second resolution, and also strong labels with precise location of the signals of the identified species.

**Biomes:** This dataset covers two unique tropical biomes, the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, providing a representation of environmental sound across different ecosystems.

**Sites:** It contains audio recordings from four distinct geographical sites, ensuring diversity in the acoustic environments and capturing soundscapes from various locations.

**Species:** The dataset encompasses a rich biodiversity with recordings of 42 different tropical anuran species. Researchers and enthusiasts can explore the acoustic signatures of various fauna, aiding in biodiversity monitoring and conservation efforts.

**Preprocessed Samples:** The dataset also includes 93 thousand preprocessed audio samples. Each sample is fixed at a length of 3 seconds, making it suitable for standard machine learning models. These preprocessed samples have undergone necessary transformations to ensure consistency and compatibility for analysis.
